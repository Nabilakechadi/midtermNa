What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
B Java Development Kit components :
1-JRE:run the program
2-jar: jar archive is a archival and compression tool based on ZIP and ZLIB compression formats.
3-javac: java compiler javac  reads all the class information , interfaces and the other
 codes written in Java programming language and compiles them into byte code.
4-javap: Java Disassembler disassembles one or more classes which is passed. The javap command prints the package,
 protected and public fields, and methods of the classes passed to it. The javap command prints its output to stdout.
5-jdb:Java Debugger is a command-line debugger for Java classes it helps us in debugging our Java code.
In order to start debugging we simply need to give the class name after jdb.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
-The main difference between PATH and CLASSPATH is that Path is set for java tools in java programs like java and javac,
 which are used to compile your code.
 but CLASSPATH is used by System or Application class loader to locate and load compile Java bytecodes stored in the  class file.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
-the main difference between an interface and an abstract class is that an interface cannot have state,
 but the abstract class can have state with instance variables.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
-No, you cannot . you need to implement a subclass of abstract class which, of course, must not be abstract.

what is Access Specifier?
Define the visibility of the class.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
-OOP is Object oriented Programming . its features are :
*encapsulation: dictates that one class must not have access to the (private) data of another class
*inheritance:dictates that a child class (subclass) inherits all the attributes and methods from a parent class (superclass)
*polymorphism:  the ability of an object to take on many forms.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
-java package used to group related classes. java. lang package and a no-name package  are reported by default.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
-Application programming interface An API is an interface that software developers use to programmatically
 interact with software components or resources outside of their own code.
 API examples : weather , twitter, paypal...

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
-No,  because it can lead  to diamond problem.
What is method overloading and when it happens?
-is a concept of Java in which we can create multiple methods of the same name in the same class, and all methods work in different ways.
-Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters.
Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
-An exception object is an instance of an exception class. It gets created and handed to
the Java runtime when an exceptional event occurred that disrupted the normal flow of the application
What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
- static keyword is mainly used for memory management.Static variables are used with the class name and the dot operator,
 since they are associated with a class, not objects of a class.
What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
-The final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable.
-It has been used  when you want a variable to always store the same value.
What is final, finally and finalize?
-Final is a keyword and is used as access modifier in Java. Finally is a block in Java used for Exception Handling.
Finalize is a method in Java used for Garbage Collection. Application.
What is a constructor ?
- is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.
Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
yes, we can.
If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
-Default creation.
What is "this" keyword in java ?
-refers to the current object in a method or constructor
What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
-refers to superclass (parent) objects.
What is JVM stand for ?
-java virtual machine
Is JVM platform independent?
-yes, it is.
What version of java are you using?
-11
What is JAR stand for ?
-Jar ARchive.
What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
-JDK used to develop Java applications ND JRE is the implementation of JDK and it is specially designed to execute Java programs.
What is compile time and run time?
-Compile time is the period when the programming code is converted to the machine code.
Runtime is the period of time when a program is running and generally occurs after compile time.
What is heap?
-The Java heap is the area of memory used to store objects instantiated by applications running on the JVM.
How java manage it's memory?
-Java uses an automatic memory management system called a garbage collector.
What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
-String is immutable whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable classes. StringBuffer is thread-safe and synchronized
 whereas StringBuilder is not.
What is Singleton class?
-is a class that can have only one object
What is Serialization and Deserialization?
-Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.
 Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory.
when to use transient variable in java?
-used to indicate that a field should not be part of the serialization process
Difference between while and do..while loop?
-The difference between while and do while loop is that in the while loop the condition is checked prior to executing
 any statements whereas in the case of do while loop, statements are run at least once, and then the condition is verified.
What is Enum?

-Integer.
Why is String Immutable in Java?
-because of the security.
-
What is constructor chaining in Java?
-is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.
The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
-The primary difference between the serial and parallel collectors is that the parallel collector has multiple
 threads that are used to speed up garbage collection.
What is JIT stands for?
-J ust In Time
Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
-Java objects reside in an area called the heap When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected.
Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
-No
What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
-Heap memory is used by all the parts of the application whereas stack memory is used only by one thread of execution.
What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
-Reflection is a feature in the Java programming language. It allows an executing Java program to examine
and manipulate internal properties of the program.
what is multithreading in java?
-refers to a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously for maximum utilization of the CPU.
What is the use of synchronization in Java?
-is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource
What is Framework?
- bodies of reusable pre-written code acting as templates that developers can use to create applications by filling in
custom code as needed.
What are the testing Framework available in java?
-selenium, Junit ,testNG...
Difference between jUnit and testNG?
-JUnit is a framework that is open-source and may be used to write and trigger tests. TestNG is a Java-based
framework that provides an improved way to run tests.
What are the dependencies for this project?
-
what is dependency injection in java?
- is a way to achieve Inversion of control in our application by moving objects binding from compile time to runtime
What is static binding and dynamic binding?
-If a body of the method at runtime is bonded to a method call then it is called dynamic, and
The binding which can be resolved at compile time by the compiler is known as static
