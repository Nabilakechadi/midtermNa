what is an Array?
D. is a collection of similar types of data.



what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
E.An array has both primitive data types as well as object data types. However, ArrayList has only object-type data
entries and not primitive data types.


what is LinkedList?
F.is an ordered collection that contains many objects of the same type.


How is an Array different from Linked List?
An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type.

what is queue?
. is an object that represents a data structure designed to have the element inserted at the end of the queue,
and the element removed from the beginning of the queue.

what is stack?
.is a class that falls under the Collection framework that extends the Vector class

what is FIFO and LIFO?
.First IN First Out , Last In First Out.

what is the order of complexity?
The most common complexity classes are (in ascending order of complexity): O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(nÂ²).

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
Sequential search

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
when the search item appears at the end of the list or not at all.


what is tree in data structure?
 is a non-linear data structure where data objects are generally organized in terms of hierarchical relationship

what is graph in data structure?
 is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values whereas Hashtable doesn't allow any null key or value

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
Answer: RDBMS = Array,  Network data model = Graph. Hierarchical data model = Trees

How HashMap works in java?
.HashMap stores entries into multiple singly linked lists, called buckets or bins.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
.is a runtime exception in Java that occurs when an array is accessed with an illegal index.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
.Iterating each element of the given original array and copy one element at a time.
 Using clone() method.
 Using arraycopy() method.

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
.An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type. Linked List is an ordered collection of elements
of the same type in which each element is connected to the next using pointers.

What is DFS and BFS?
BFS stands for Breadth First Search. DFS stands for Depth First Search. Technique. It a vertex-based technique to find
 the shortest path in a graph.

What is Recursion?
is the technique of making a function call itself

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
.In a linear data structure, the data elements connect to each other sequentially.
In a non-linear data structure, the data elements connect to each other hierarchically.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
 is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
.Selection sort.
 Bubble sort.
 Insertion sort.
 Merge sort.
 Quick sort.
 Heap sort.
 Counting sort.
 Radix sort.
